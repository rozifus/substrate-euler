# substrate-euler
Project euler in substrate for fun and learning

Note

`substrate is definately not the most efficient tool for solving project euler problems`

but

`project euler is a great way to learn the basics of any language or framework (imo)`

and

`using constrained systems for solving problems can incentivize you to discover optimizations that lead to deeper understanding`
